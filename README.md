# Parareal-HODMD
This is the Python implementation of the Parareal-HODMD algorithm, which a parallel-in-time algorithm based on Parareal and High-Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition for solving differential equations.

The repository contains the code for the three numerical examples presented in the paper.


# How To Run
The code is written in Python 3.9. The parameters in the code are chosen in consistent with the paper. 

Example of running the rod swimmer example with 50 cores:

mpirun -np 50 python Parareal_DMD_5ds.py


## RodSwimmerExample
- The folder contains the code for the simulation of a single rod swimmer solved using the Method of Regularized Stokeslets (MRS) with regularization parameter $\epsilon=3\sigma$ and $\epsilon=5\sigma$. The parameters of the examples in this folder are set to run with 50 cores.

## SphereSwimmerExample
- The folder contains the code for the simulation of an elastic sphere in shear flow solved using the Method of Regularized Stokeslets (MRS). The parameters of the examples in this folder are set to run with 50 cores.

## ThinFilmExample
- The folder contains the code for the simulation of thin liquid film on a chemically heterogeneous substrate using the approximate Newton-ADI method. The parameters of the examples in this folder are set to run with 10 cores.
